# Overview

In this post we will see how we can achieve very precise position control of simple DC motor. We have use Arduino and PID calculation to achieve precise position control of simple DC motor.

Such small project are very much fun to do, you can learn many concept like PID, Close loop system & encoder basic by building this project.

First of all I want to let you brief about what is PID, because this will help you to understand the things further.


# PID

PID stands for proportional derivative and integral calculation

PID is the part of programming, on which a complex calculation carried out by controller and manipulate the Output as per the feedback from the process.

There is 4 key values of PID
1. PV (process value) or feedback
2. SV (set value)
3. Error
4. Output

Basic PID working is as follow, I am not going into complex arithmetic an calculus formulas because I want to keep it simple.

PID try to keep PV as near as possible to SV.
Error = SV-PV Error is difference between Set value and process value
and Output is directly prepositional to Error hence in other words we can say greater the difference between SV and PV greater the Output, if Error is positive output is positive if error is negative output is negative. As PV reach closer and closer to SV the Error get smaller and smaller so on Output also get smaller and smaller, so in this way we get a clean and precise output.
Here is a real life example.

Suppose I tell you to drive a break less car exactly 1 km on straight road
because you donâ€™t have break so the throttle is all you can use to control the car
so you get in car press the throttle and accelerate for a while then release throttle to decelerate and gradually stop at the 1km point.
this is all what you have done we can call it PID control. PID knows how to manipulate output before reaching the SP

Kp, Ki, Kd are the parameters by which we can fine tune the PID controller
those parameter can control over shoot undershoot oscillation.

Suppose a micro-controller drive the car without PID, it will start the car and continue to accelerate until reach the 1km point.

and then release the throttle due momentum car continue to move and gradually stop way beyond to our set point of 1km.

then again micro-controller reverse the car and accelerate as he came back to 1km point release the throttle again same thing happen it continue to move in back due to momentum and such cycle repeat again and again.

you can imagine now it is almost impossible for a controller to stop the car at fixed point with out PID

Below is the visual to understand how PID smooth motion looks.

# How it works

A double shaft simple DC gear motor is connected with shaft of encoder on one side and on other side a pointer is connected this pointer points the angle marked on protractor, encoder is connected with arduino on interrupt pins and DC motor drive by L293D motor IC, a HC-05 module is use to connect our system with android device

When we send angle setpoint from android device arduino receive the data and run the Motor meanwhile encoder sends real time position feedback to arduino as per predefined calculation when encoder pulse matched with requirement it means pointer reach the desire position arduinuo stop the DC motor at such potion. all the process is controlled by PID for smooth and clean motion.

For example here we have used a optical encoder which give 1600 transition pulse for 360 degree revolution, so if we want to rotate pointer to 90 degree so the 1600/360 x 90 = 400 pulse from encoder tells us it moves 90 degree.

# Components

I have used a simple BO motor a optical encoder is connected to its shaft a 360 degree protractor is used as a scale HC-05 bt module is used to connect arduino and android device and a android mobile phone to run android app to send angle set-point to arduino

I have used here a 400 ppr 2 phase incremental optical encoder this encoder can give reference of 1600 translation per evolution means 800 transition per phase, we need to connect pullup resistor connected to phase A and phase B because we cannot leave pin floating to avoid any disturbance, in our case we are using arduino which have inbuilt pull up resistor facility just need to activated from code.

```javascript
 pinMode(encoderPin1, INPUT_PULLUP); 
  pinMode(encoderPin2, INPUT_PULLUP);
```
